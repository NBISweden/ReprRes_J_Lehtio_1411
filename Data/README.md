# Original data

## Protein data emailed by Henrik Johansson 151117   
   * __9995_BC_45_proteome_Gene_symbol_centric_1FDR.xlsx__
   the excel file from Henrik with raw gene-based proteomics data for 45 tumours.
   The accompanying email held the following info:
   _...the proteomics data for the 45 tumors. The proteomics data has been assembled based on gene symbols and limited to a 1% protein FDR._
   * __diffProtdata_extracted_from_9995_BC_45_proteome_Gene_symbol_centric_1FDR.xlsx__
   This is the "Relative ratios to pool (131)" data extracted from 9995_BC_45_proteome_Gene_symbol_centric_1FDR.xlsx with empty or superfluous rows and columns removed. Done in excel. Use this in analysis

## mRNA data from Kristine Kleive 151118. This will be updated to GRCh37 gene symbols by the script 'updating_gene_symbols.R'
   * __main_qnorm_missimp_cent-hosp_log2_annot_updated_ids_to_Janne.txt__
   the data file in tab-delimited txt format downloaded from Kristines google drive. Use this in analysis.
   The accpmpanying email held the following relevant info: _attached mRNA data. OSL2U-0219 is performed twice, you could choose T8, which is the same tumor piece that you have performed proteomics on. Alternatively, take the mean of the two. It is different tumor pieces from the tumour.
Data is quantile normalised and log2 transformed._
  

## Meta data
   * __151111_clin_info_connect_protoemics.xlsx__
   the meta data for tumours.

   * __Genelists-summary160606.xlsx__
   excel file with diff protein groups of interest in columns and the gene symbols of its members the row of each column -* NB! No connection between rows of different columns

   * __KEGG_n_Hallmark_genes_for_mRNA-protein_corr.xlsx__
   Additional protein groups defined a posteriori by Henrik Johansson 160904. TO be added to list above.
   
   * __COSMICn_BC_drivers.xlsx__
   Additional protein groups defined a posteriori by Henrik Johansson 180905. TO be added to list above.
